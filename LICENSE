# About Us 
At our small shop, we combine a deep understanding of physics and
fundamental electronics to achieve results others might deem 
overly complex or expensive. We handle everything in-house, from 
designing circuits and PCBs using discrete components to writing
firmware and integrating with cloud components, machine learning 
and GUIs as needed.  Our key engineer has been a fortune 50 
principal architect, chief enterprise architect,  CTO, venture
funded CEO and holds multiple patents in both software and atmospheric 
water generators.

#### Need help accelerating your impossible project?
If others have told you your project is impossible or will take years, we can help! We excel at taking on challenges others shy away from.

#### Tired of cookie-cutter solutions?
We understand your frustration with engineers who simply slap open-source firmware on existing boards and call it a product? We offer a more tailored approach, engineering unqiue solutions crafted specifically to solve your problems.

#### Let's talk!
If you're looking for a team that can take your project from concept to reality, we'd love to hear from you.
