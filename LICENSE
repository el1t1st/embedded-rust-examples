We are unique in small shops in the USA.  We do all our own circuit and
PCB design from discrete components up,  We write the firmware and 
integrate with cloud components and GUI as needed.  If you have a project
others have told you is impossible or will take years then talk to use as 
we may be able help you accelerate.  If you are tired of engineers that take
a opensource board and slap some stock opensource firmware on it to call it 
a product then we can help.
